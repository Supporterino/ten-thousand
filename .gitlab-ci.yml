image: docker:20.10.23

variables:
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2376
  #
  # The 'docker' hostname is the alias of the service container as described at
  # https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/services/#accessing-the-services.
  # If you're using GitLab Runner 12.7 or earlier with the Kubernetes executor and Kubernetes 1.6 or earlier,
  # the variable must be set to tcp://localhost:2376 because of how the
  # Kubernetes executor connects services to the job container
  # DOCKER_HOST: tcp://localhost:2376
  #
  # Specify to Docker where to create the certificates. Docker
  # creates them automatically on boot, and creates
  # `/certs/client` to share between the service and job
  # container, thanks to volume mount from config.toml
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
  # These are usually specified by the entrypoint, however the
  # Kubernetes executor doesn't run entrypoints
